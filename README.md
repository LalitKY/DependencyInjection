* We need to parse this file * We need to show a list of items available in file. 
* 
* * There is a "timeRemaining" key so we need to run a timer for the remaining time and update the same on the UI. 
* 
* * After completing the time we need to show an alert "Do you want to delete this item" with the "cancel" or "delete" button. 
* 
* * if you tap onÂ "delete" row will be deleted from the list.
